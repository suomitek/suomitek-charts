# WildFly

[Wildfly](http://wildfly.org/) formerly known as JBoss AS, or simply JBoss, is an application server authored by JBoss, now developed by Red Hat. WildFly is written in Java, and implements the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) specification.

## TL;DR

```console
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
$ helm install my-release bitnami/wildfly
```

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [WildFly](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-wildfly) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Bitnami charts can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters. This Helm chart has been tested on top of [Bitnami Kubernetes Production Runtime](https://kubeprod.io/) (BKPR). Deploy BKPR to get automated TLS certificates, logging and monitoring for your applications.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.12+
- Helm 2.12+ or Helm 3.0-beta3+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure
- ReadWriteMany volumes for deployment scaling

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
$ helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
$ helm install my-release bitnami/wildfly
```

These commands deploy WildFly on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Parameters

The following tables lists the configurable parameters of the WildFly chart and their default values.

The above parameters map to the env variables defined in [bitnami/wildfly](http://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-wildfly). For more information please refer to the [bitnami/wildfly](http://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-wildfly) image documentation.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```console
$ helm install my-release \
  --set wildflyUser=manager,wildflyPassword=password \
    bitnami/wildfly
```

The above command sets the WildFly management username and password to `manager` and `password` respectively.

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```console
$ helm install my-release -f values.yaml bitnami/wildfly
```

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)

## Configuration and installation details

### [Rolling VS Immutable tags](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/understand-rolling-tags-containers/)

It is strongly recommended to use immutable tags in a production environment. This ensures your deployment does not change automatically if the same tag is updated with a different image.

Bitnami will release a new chart updating its containers if a new version of the main container, significant changes, or critical vulnerabilities exist.

### Sidecars
If you have a need for additional containers to run within the same pod as  Wildfly (e.g. an additional metrics or logging exporter), you can do so via the sidecars config parameter. Simply define your container according to the Kubernetes container spec.

```
sidecars:
  - name: your-image-name
    image: your-image
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    ports:
      - name: portname
      containerPort: 1234
```

## Persistence

The [Bitnami WildFly](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-wildfly) image stores the WildFly data and configurations at the `/bitnami/wildfly` path of the container.

Persistent Volume Claims are used to keep the data across deployments. This is known to work in GCE, AWS, and minikube.
See the [Parameters](#parameters) section to configure the PVC or to disable persistence.

### Adjust permissions of persistent volume mountpoint

As the image run as non-root by default, it is necessary to adjust the ownership of the persistent volume so that the container can write data into it.

By default, the chart is configured to use Kubernetes Security Context to automatically change the ownership of the volume. However, this feature does not work in all Kubernetes distributions.
As an alternative, this chart supports using an initContainer to change the ownership of the volume before mounting it in the final destination.

You can enable this initContainer by setting `volumePermissions.enabled` to `true`.

## Upgrading

### To 2.1.0

WildFly container was moved to a non-root approach. There shouldn't be any issue when upgrading since the corresponding `securityContext` is enabled by default. Both the container image and the chart can be upgraded by running the command below:

```
$ helm upgrade my-release bitnami/wildfly
```

If you use a previous container image (previous to **14.0.1-r75**) disable the `securityContext` by running the command below:

```
$ helm upgrade my-release bitnami/wildfly --set securityContext.enabled=fase,image.tag=XXX
```

### To 1.0.0

Backwards compatibility is not guaranteed unless you modify the labels used on the chart's deployments.
Use the workaround below to upgrade from versions previous to 1.0.0. The following example assumes that the release name is wildfly:

```console
$ kubectl patch deployment wildfly --type=json -p='[{"op": "remove", "path": "/spec/selector/matchLabels/chart"}]'
```
